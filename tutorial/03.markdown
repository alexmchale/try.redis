There is something special about [INCR](#help).  Why do we provide such an operation if
we can do it ourself with a bit of code? After all it is as simple as:

    x = GET count
    x = x + 1
    SET count x

The problem is that doing the increment in this way will only work as long as
there is a single client using the key. See what happens if two clients are
accessing this key at the same time:

1. Client A reads *count* as 10.
2. Client B reads *count* as 10.
3. Client A increments 10 and sets *count* to 11.
4. Client B increments 10 and sets *count* to 11.

We wanted the value to be 12, but instead it is 11! This is because
incrementing the value in this way is not an atomic operation.  Calling the
[INCR](#help) command in Redis will prevent this from happening, because it *is* an
atomic operation. Redis provides many of these atomic operations on different
types of data.
