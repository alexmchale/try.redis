Redis can be told that a key should only exist for a certain length of time.
This is accomplished with the [EXPIRE](#help) and [TTL](#help) commands.

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">SET resource:lock "Redis Demo"</a>
    <a href="#run">EXPIRE resource:lock 120</a>
</code></pre>

This causes the key *resource:lock* to be deleted in 120 seconds. You can test
how long a key will exist for with the [TTL](#help) command. It returns the number of
seconds until it will be deleted.

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">TTL resource:lock</a> => 113
    <a href="#run">TTL count</a> => -1
</code></pre>

The *-1* for the [TTL](#help) of the key *count* means that it will never expire. Note
that if you [SET](#help) a key, its [TTL](#help) will reset.

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">SET resource:lock "Redis Demo 1"</a>
    <a href="#run">EXPIRE resource:lock 120</a>
    <a href="#run">TTL resource:lock</a> => 119
    <a href="#run">SET resource:lock "Redis Demo 2"</a>
    <a href="#run">TTL resource:lock</a> => -1
</code></pre>
