Redis is what is called a key-value store, often referred to as a NoSQL
database. The essence of a key-value store is the ability to store some data,
called a value, inside a key. This data can later be retrieved only if we know
the exact key used to store it. We can use the command [SET](#help) to store the value
"fido" at key "server:name":

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">SET server:name "fido"</a>
</code></pre>

Redis will store our data permanently, so we can later ask "What is the value
stored at key server:name?" and Redis will reply with "fido":

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">GET server:name</a> => "fido"
</code></pre>
